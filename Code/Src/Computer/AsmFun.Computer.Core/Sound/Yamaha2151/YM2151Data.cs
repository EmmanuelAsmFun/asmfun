    Noise LFO waveform.

    Here are just 256 samples out of much longer data.

    It does NOT repeat every 256 samples on real chip and I wasnt able to find
    the point where it repeats (even in strings as long as 131072 samples).

    I only put it here because its better than nothing and perhaps
    someone might be able to figure out the real algorithm.


    Note that (due to the way the LFO output is calculated) it is quite
    possible that two values: 0x80 and 0x00 might be wrong in this table.
    To be exact:
        some 0x80 could be 0x81 as well as some 0x00 could be 0x01.
